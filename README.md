Haplotype distance matrix illustrating the genetic differences between haplotypes of Laephotis capensis based on mitochondrial gene sequences (CYTB and CO1). Each cell in the matrix represents the pairwise genetic distance between haplotypes, with darker shading indicating greater genetic divergence. The matrix highlights the levels of genetic variation and differentiation between bat populations across different geographic regions. (a) depicts COX1 and (b) depicts CYTB.

Figure 5 BEAST Skygrid output, with the y-axis representing effective population size and the x-axis showing time in years. (a) displays the original Skygrid output generated in Tracer, while (b) presents a scaled-up version of the same graph. These graphs depict changes in the population size over time, with (b) an adjusted scale for better interpretation of population dynamics.
